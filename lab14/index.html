		<h1> Lab 14: Debugging Tools and Strategies </h1>
    <h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p> With a partner, use your debugging knowledge to fix old assignments</p>
    <h3> Problems </h3>
		<p> My pages all function how they're supposed to, so it was difficult finding issues to debug </p>
		<h4> Results </h4>
    <p> Below are screenshots of my homepage, which initially had problems connecting to the CSS stylesheet</p>
		<h5> Debugging </h5>
		<p> In my main index.html, it couldn't detect the site.css stylesheet. I mulled this over for a few weeks but I couldn't figure out what was wrong. Finally, I realized that the issue was that I didn't link the CSS properly by adding in href="css/lab.css" It was a really small issue, so it completely slipped my mind.</p>
