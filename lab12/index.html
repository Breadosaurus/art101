		<h1> Lab 12: Conditionals </h1>
    <h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p> Working with your partner, create a function that depends on conditionals</p>
    <h3> Problems </h3>
		<p> We ran into a few issues regarding syntax during this lab, but we figured out our typos and fixed them.</p>
		<h4> Results </h4>
    <p> Our final webpage sorts the user into their respective Hogwarts house based on the number of letters in their name. The final code is simplified by using mod as an index.</p>
		<div class = "input-output">
			<h2> Welcome to Hogwarts </h2>
			<p> Prepare to be Sorted Into Your House</p>
			Please enter your FULL name for sorting:
			<input type = "text" id = "input">
			<button id = "button"> Submit </button>
